### Project Scope: Learning OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect using Python

#### Project Title: Implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in Python

#### Project Objective:
To understand and implement OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect using Python. The project will focus on creating a simple web application that demonstrates the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow and OpenID Connect authentication.

#### Project Deliverables:
1. A Python web application with a front-end interface.
2. Implementation of OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow.
3. Integration of OpenID Connect for user authentication.
4. Documentation detailing the setup, configuration, and execution of the project.

#### Technologies and Tools:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Provider:** Google, GitHub, or Auth0
- **Libraries:** `requests`, `oauthlib`, `flask-oauthlib`, `python-jose`, `flask-login`
- **Development Tools:** VS Code or PyCharm, Postman, Git

#### Project Steps:

1. **Project Setup:**
    - Create a virtual environment and install Flask.
    - Install necessary libraries: `pip install flask requests oauthlib python-jose flask-login`.

2. **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:**
    - Register the application with the OAuth 2.0 provider to obtain client ID and client secret.
    - Create authorization URL to redirect the user for authentication.
    - Implement the callback endpoint to handle the authorization code and exchange it for an access token.
    - Store and manage access tokens securely.

3. **OpenID Connect Integration:**
    - Modify the OAuth 2.0 flow to include OpenID Connect scopes (e.g., `openid`, `profile`, `email`).
    - Handle ID tokens and validate them using `python-jose`.
    - Retrieve and display user information (e.g., name, email).

4. **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Write test cases to verify the functionality.
    - Use Postman to test API endpoints.
    - Debug and fix issues identified during testing.

5. **Documentation and Presentation:**
    - Write detailed documentation on project setup, code explanation, and usage instructions.
    - Create a demo presentation showcasing the application features and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect flow.

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Understand the principles and workflows of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
- Gain hands-on experience in implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in a Python web application.
- Learn to integrate third-party authentication providers.
- Enhance skills in secure token handling and user session management.

This project will provide a comprehensive understanding of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, equipping you with the knowledge to implement authentication and authorization in Python web applications.
